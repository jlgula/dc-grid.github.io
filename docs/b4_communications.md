# Communications

General ideas:

- Basic system control works without any higher-level communication, only based on measured grid voltage
- Energy management and higher level control (incl. monitoring) should use a protocol independent of the lower layers. So it should allow both wired (e.g. CAN, RS485) as well as radio (GSM, LoRa, WiFi, etc.) transfer methods.
